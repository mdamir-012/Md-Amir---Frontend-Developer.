# Md-Amir---Frontend-Developer.


Welcome to the Md-Amir Frontend Developer repository! This project showcases a basic yet sophisticated webpage developed with ReactJS. The primary objective was to faithfully replicate the design provided in a Figma file while ensuring optimal responsiveness across various screen sizes, including small, medium, and large screens. In addition, the project integrates wallet connection functionality through the WalletConnect protocol.
